## Visual Tracking with Mean Shift

### Introduction
This is a very simple demo, which initializes the [meanshift](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/854761/) tracking algorithm. I also write an Chinese [blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/34971165) to make details about this algorithm. If you are an English speaker, you could read the original [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/854761/).

### Prepare for using
* Matlab

### Run
You just run the script of demo_meanshift.m, And select a rectangle area to define an interest target, then let it go.
